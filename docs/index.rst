API-Skeletons/zf-doctrine-audit
===============================

This repository creates an auditing database to track your target database changes.

Auditing is a complex subject.  I've spent years trying to find an easier answer and by leveraging Object Relational Mapping through Doctrine what we have here is a plugin for new or existing Doctrine Zend Framework projects to implement auditing across a selection of entities or the whole database.
