This library creates an audit database for a target database using Doctrine ORM to define the database.  You do not need to interact with the target database through PHP in order to gain the benefit of auditing.  That is, once the two databases are configured for auditing they "just work".  

This library is targeted to Doctrine ORM applications and there are many tools to help you manage auditing within your code.
